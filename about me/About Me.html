    <h1>About me!</h1>


    	<h2>Personality</h2>
    	<p id="collab2"><em id="collab">Collaboration:</em>
    	I am a naturally introverted person. I enjoy my time alone as much if not more than I do around other people, and I pride myself in my independence. 
<div> 	</p>
    	<p id="collab2"> 
    		<em id="collab">Perseverance:</em>
    		I am fortunate enough to be gifted with the drive to try different things and really put myself out there when it came to different activities and opportunities.
    	</p>	 
</div>
<div>
		<p id="collab2">
    		<em id="collab">Respect:</em>	
    		I respect those who respect me. It's natural. As someone who likes being respected, I naturally put my pride in the fact that I respect others.

    	<h3>Technical Skills:</h3>
    	<p id="abt">I have been using computers and devices for majority of my life. Having been born in the 21st century, knowledge of technological aspects have proved to be important for me to succeed both in school and in life as a whole. Although I don't "specialize" in any specific form of tech, I feel like I have enough general knowledge that spans different relevant brands and versions to use devices without restraint.</p>

		<p id="abt">Now in the computer sciences class, I have been able to add HTML knowledge into my resume. One of the things I feel the most comfortable with is changing <strong>font size and color</strong> <em>with ease.</em>
